*Neo4j Browser*

Neo4j Browser is a developer-focused tool that allows you to execute Cypher queries and visualize the results.
It is the default developer interface for both Enterprise and Community editions of Neo4j.
It comes out-of-the-box with all of Neo4jâ€™s graph database offerings, including Neo4j Server (Community and Enterprise editions) and Neo4j Desktop (all OS versions).

Neo4j Browser is perfect for running ad-hoc graph queries, with just enough ability to prototype a Neo4j-based application.
It is:

* Developer focused, for writing and running graph queries with Cypher.
* Exportable, tabular results of any query result.
* Used for graph visualization of query results containing nodes and relationships.
