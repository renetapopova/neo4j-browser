This section walks you through the UI of Neo4j Browser.

[[overview]]
== Overview

[[sidebar]]
== Sidebar

The sidebar contains a set of drawers where you can set up the environment for graph management and exploration.

[[database-info]]
=== Database Information

The *Database Information* drawer provides information about the data of the currently used database, the roles of the current user, the Neo4j DBMS version, as well as some useful DBMS administrative commands.

image:database-information.png[height=40%]

* *Use database* - a dropdown menu, where you can select the database you want to work with.
* *Node Labels*, *Relationship Types*, and *Property keys* - clicking any one of those options runs a quick query to show you a sample of the graph with those elements.
* *Connected as* - shows the current user and their roles, as well as the cypher command to disconnect from the server.
If the current user has an administrative role, then two more options are available: `:server user add` and `:server user list`.
For more information about user's built-in roles and the default privileges, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/built-in-roles/[Operations Manual -> Built-in roles].
* *DBMS* - provides information about the Neo4j version and edition, as well as some useful DBMS administrative commands:
** `:dbs` - list all databases available for the current user.
** `sysinfo` - display data about the Neo4j system, such as, store size, ID allocation, page cache, transactions, and databases (name, address, role, status, default database, and errors).
** `:queries` - list all currently running queries on the server.

[[favorites]]
=== Favorites

The *Favorites* drawer is where you keep your bookmarked queries and commands. +
If you currently have an empty frame, you can display some nodes and relationships by using the saved scripts under *Favorites* in the left-side menu.
Neo4j stores a few default favorites to get you started.
Expand the *Basic Queries*, then choose *Get Some Data*, and run the query.
This executes the statement `MATCH (n) RETURN n limit 100`, which fetches some nodes.

You can save your own queries as favorites by "starring" them.
Populate the Cypher editor with the query you want to favorite, then click the *Save as Favorites* icon to the right of the editor.
This adds the query to your *Favorites* list in the left-side menu.
To run one of your favorites, click the left-side menu *Favorites*, choose the query, and run it.

image:favorites.png[width=150%]

To provide a title or helpful info, you can use a comment `//comment` above your query.
The *Favorites* menu uses this comment to name the saved query.

.Favorite: Hello Cypher
====
[source, cypher]
----
//Hello Cypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN n
LIMIT 100
----
====

Creating folders can help organize your favorites, and you can rearrange them by dragging, or delete them if they are no longer useful.

[NOTE]
====
Your favorites, settings, and styles can be saved to the cloud with Neo4j Browser Sync. If you clear your Browser cache, your local favorites will be removed.

[[help-learn]]
=== Help & Learn

The *Help & Learn* drawer contains useful commands, built-in guides, links to documentation, notifications, and a send feedback button.

[[guides]]
==== Built-in guides

Neo4j Browser provides many interactive guides for learning concepts and tools with Neo4j.
From data import to graph algorithms to working with RDF data, there is likely an interactive browser guide out there to walk through it.
If there is not one that fits your needs, you can create one and publish it to the community or internally at your company.
For more information on how to do that, see link:https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-create-neo4j-browser-guide/[creating a custom Browser guide].

Some guides ship with Neo4j Browser out-of-the-box, no matter what system or installation you are working on.
The Browser built-in guides are quick guides that introduce different Neo4j concepts.
You can find more helpful links in the left sidebar of Neo4j in the "Documents" tab ().
To pin a particular pane to the top of the window (under the editor) so that it stays at the top when you run queries after it, just click the pushpin button ().
This is especially helpful for pinning guides to the top so they do not get pushed down to the bottom of the window as you run queries.

[TIP]
====
There are also other guides, which are created by Neo4j staff and community members to help others learn Neo4j or how to use the tools in its ecosystem. +
You can check out the currently published list on the link:https://portal.graphgist.org/graph_guides[GraphGist Portal (Graph Guides section)]. +

[[settings]]
=== Browser Settings

// https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-browser/#browser-config
The defaults for all the settings can be adjusted at any time by going to the configuration option on the left-side menu.
Some possible config changes and views are the following:

* You can retrieve the current configuration with `:config`.
* Individual settings are configured with the following defaults:
** `:config maxNeighbours:100`- maximum number of neighbours for a node
** `:config maxRows:100` - maximum number of rows for the tabular result

You can also see the current status on your database, such as store sizes, ID allocation, page cache, and transaction info by using the command `:sysinfo` in the editor.
//https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/sysinfo_stats.png

To override the configuration settings -> https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/how-do-i-override-browser-configuration-settings/

To remove the automatic completion of missing relationships, uncheck the `Connect result nodes` in *Settings* .

Configuration settings can be set in _neo4j.conf_ or if using Neo4j Desktop, navigate to the DBMS which settings you want to update, click the ellipsis dropdown menu, and select *Settings*.

[[about-neo4j]]
=== About Neo4j

The *About Neo4j* drawer provides information about

[[editor]]
== Cypher editor

The Cypher editor is the primary interface for entering and running commands.
From Neo4j Browser 4.2.4, the Cypher editor is based on Monaco link:https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/[https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/], the editor that powers VS Code link:https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode[https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode].

Some of its features include:

* Syntax highlighting
** A smart highlight of matching pairs around the current position of the cursor, for example, matching brackets, braces, and parenthesis.
** A smart highlight of identical words on a word click.
You can select them by pressing *Command + D* (one occurrence at a time) or by command+shift L (all occurrences).
* Command palette (F1)
* Quick comment/uncomment
* Moving query parts around
* Folding and indentation


* Cypher queries to work with graph data.
* Client-side commands like `:help` for other operations.
* REST request commands (`:GET`, `:POST`, `:PUT`, and `:DELETE`).
* Single line editing for brief queries or commands.
* Switch to multi-line editing with *<Shift-Enter>*.
* Run a query with *<Ctrl-Enter>* or *<Cmd-Enter>*.
* History is kept for easily retrieving previous commands.
* Autocomplete for browser commands.
* Move focus to the editor with /.
* Toggle the editor to full screen with ESC.

Use the command `:help keys` for information about keyboard shortcuts.

[[frames]]
== Result frames

[[frame-views]]
=== Result frame views

* Graph - Display the result as nodes and relationships. Styling can be configured.
* Table - Display the result as JSON formatted rows.
* Text - Display the result as a plain text table.
* Code https://browser.graphapp.io/assets/images/screen_code_frame.png - View the requests and responses.

[stream]
=== Stream

// https://browser.graphapp.io/assets/images/screen_stream.png

Scrolling series of frames (mostly reusable result frames).

A reusable result frame is created for each command execution, added to the top of the stream to create a scrollable collection in reverse chronological order.

Remove all the frames from the stream with the :clear command.

[[reusable-frames]]
=== Reusable result frames

Cells with results that you can reiterate on.

Now, when you need to edit the query of an existing result frame to fix a mistake, you can do that directly in the result frame and update the results in situ.

The reusable frame maintains its own local history of commands as well as updating the main Cypher editor, should you need to instantiate a new result frame from there.
